    Disc Synth, is a synthesizer in the shape of disc... Ta Da! ;)<br>
    There are 3 layers to the disc, each layer corresponds to an oscillator. Each layer is broken up into "discs".
    To activate a disc (ie. play a sound), click on it. To adjust the frequency (the number in the middle of the disc)
    hold down the CTRL key, mouse down on the disc, and then drag your mouse up/down to adjust.
