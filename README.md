# DiscSynth

DEMO: <a href="http://discsynth.dearthfunk.com/">http://discsynth.dearthfunk.com/</a>

A synthesizer in the shape of a disc with layers (each represents one oscillator type). You can adjust the length of the disc, volume, and speed of playback (tempo) using the 3 sliders in the top right. To activate a cell simply click on it, now it will play. If you click and drag, you change the frequency of that cell. You can start and stop playback by pressing the Space bar or the large STOP/START button in the middle. You can also toggle the bypass on fx units during playback using the 1 thorugh 6 number keys.
